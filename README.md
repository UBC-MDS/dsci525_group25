# Rainfall Prediction Model of Group 25 for Course 525

This is the repository of group 25 for course 525 Web and Cloud Computing.
This repository contains a python project to build ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~5 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

## Data 
The dataset used by this project is from [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681), put together by Tom.
